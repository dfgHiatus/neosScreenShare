# neosScreenShare
A proof-of-concept screen sharing application for NeosVR. This is more of a gimmick than an actual invention, but I'll leave it up to you to determine its value. Made with Python 3.8.6

To use, download the .EXE and run it (Source is available for our Linux friends). As long as appDesktop.exe is running in the task manager, it should be running fine. With the .EXE open, go to my public folder "dfg's Contraptions" and spawn a copy of the desktop viewer. Connect to the websocket with you as the user, then activate the timer. This should make it run, feel free to adjust the refresh rate as you see fit,
